In a hole in the ground lived a hobbit. Not a dirty, dirty and wet hole, filled with earthworms and a sweet smell, nor a dry, naked and sandy hole, with nothing to sit or eat: it was a hobbit hole, and that means comfort.

He had a perfectly round door like a porthole, painted green, with a bright yellow brass button in the exact middle. The door looked out on a tube-shaped corridor, like a tunnel: a very comfortable smokeless tunnel, with paneled walls, tiled and carpeted floors, polished chairs, many claws for hats and coats.
